Deep Neural Network for predicting bark beetle disturbance using TensorFlow.
The data used for training and testing are observations from the Bavarian National Park, avaialable here: http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.c5g9s

Files:
prepare.data.R: R-Script for data preparation
bb_model_Experiment1.py: Deep Neural Network used for Experiment 1
bb_model_Experiment2.py: Deep Neural Network used for Experiment 2
training_data.zip: pre-processed training data (prepare.data.R)



Steps to set up and run the model:
    * install Tensorflow (tested with 0.12 and 1.0): https://www.tensorflow.org/install
    * install TFLearn (0.3): http://tflearn.org
    * download the training data from DRYAD: http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.c5g9s
    * run the pre-processing steps (once) or use the data in training_data.zip: prepare.data.R (requires R: https://www.r-project.org/)
    * run this script and modify the paths if required (Assumptions: training data is stored in the working directory, TensorFlow logdirectory in /tmp/)
