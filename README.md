# BBPredNet
Deep Neural Network for predicting bark beetle outbreaks.

BBPredNet is an example for the application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for ecological data. The network is trained with data from a 23 year time series from bark beetle outbreaks from the Bavaria National Park, Germany. The network predicts the risk for bark beetle attack for individual 30 m cells based on the distribution of potential host trees and recent bark beetle activity in the vicinity of the cell.

BBPredNet will be avaialable soon.
